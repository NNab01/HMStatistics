<main>
    <p>
        This page explains the behavior of mean and variance over time for both **Bernoulli processes** and **random walks**. It discusses the differences between absolute and relative frequency trajectories, along with the impact of different distributions.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Mean and Variance in Bernoulli Processes</h2>
    <p><strong>Absolute Frequency:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mean:</strong> In a Bernoulli process, the mean represents the cumulative number of successes over time. It increases steadily as each trial potentially adds successes, growing proportionally to the success probability \( p \).</li>
        <li><strong>Variance:</strong> Variance also increases over time, widening as the number of trials increases. It grows at a slower rate than the mean due to the factor \( p(1 - p) \), which accounts for the probability of both success and failure.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Relative Frequency:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The mean for relative frequency tends to stabilize as the number of trials increases. The trajectory of the mean starts off volatile but converges towards \( p \) as the number of trials grows.</li>
        <li><strong>Variance:</strong> The variance decreases over time, as relative frequency becomes more stable and centered around \( p \), with fluctuations diminishing as the number of trials increases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Mean and Variance in Random Walks</h2>
    <p><strong>Absolute Frequency:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mean:</strong> In random walks, the mean tracks the net movement. Over time, the expected mean stays close to zero (if there is no bias), but individual realizations can diverge widely.</li>
        <li><strong>Variance:</strong> Variance grows quadratically with time since the walk spreads out further from the origin with each additional step.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Relative Frequency:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mean:</strong> Like the Bernoulli case, the relative frequency in random walks stabilizes over time, reflecting the expected probability of a step in either direction.</li>
        <li><strong>Variance:</strong> Variance in relative frequency diminishes over time as fluctuations average out. In a large number of trials, the distribution becomes centered around the expected proportion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Comparing Distributions</h2>
    <p><strong>Absolute Number of Successes vs Relative Frequencies:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Absolute Number of Successes:</strong> The absolute distribution of successes widens with time, becoming more spread out as successes accumulate. The mean increases steadily, while the variance grows as more trials occur.</li>
        <li><strong>Relative Frequencies:</strong> The relative frequency distribution, on the other hand, becomes tighter over time, with fluctuations shrinking as trials accumulate. The mean of the relative frequency converges toward the true probability \( p \) as the number of trials increases, while variance decreases.</li>
    </ul>
</main>

<!-- Section for Exercise -->
<h2 class="section-title">Exercise</h2>
<div class="exercise">
    <p><strong>Assignment:</strong></p>
    <p>Refine your Eulerâ€“Maruyama simulator to approximate numerical solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), by implementing the following variants within the existing framework:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A.</strong> Jumps -1 and +1 with probability \( p \) (random walk).</li>
        <li><strong>B.</strong> Absolute and relative frequency trajectories.</li>
        <li><strong>C.</strong> Final distribution and intermediate distributions (at a selected internal time/step from the GUI), including mean and variance. Make the implementation parametric so that a single interface handles all cases.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can find the code for this exercise <a href="https://github.com/NNab01/NNab01.github.io/blob/main/hm2ex.html">here</a>, and the online result can be accessed <a href="hm2ex.html">here</a>.</p>
